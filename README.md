# webbrowser
A Python application to complete. It tokenizes and parses HTML and Javascript with the ability to detect syntax errors and point out the error point.
The parser uses SR Parser so as to parse. Took this class course under Prof. Westley Weimer and learnt how to build your own simple web browser complete with the ability to parse and understand HTML and JavaScript.
